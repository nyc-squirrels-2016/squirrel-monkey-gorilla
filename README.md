 This app was made by team Squirrel Monkey Gorilla 2/19-2/21.  The team is made up of Un Choi, Devin Mandelbaum, Matt Oppenhiemer and Steven King. 
Our app, SMG, allows users to create and take surveys.  At this point, questions in the survey are limited to 4 possible responses. Users can also view the results of any survey to see how people have answered each question. 

Here's a link to our Trello board: https://trello.com/b/hBsyLd2k/smg

Our team of 4 began by white boarding our schema as a group.  We then stayed as a large group to create our migrations and models.  After this we broke into pairs to work on most of the project.  We finished out the project by grouping together to work on AJAX and error handling.  Our git workflow was simple.  We pushed our branches up and made a pull request. Someone from the other pair would make the merge.
